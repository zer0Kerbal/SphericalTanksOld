# KerbalGuise Engineering eXperimental (KGEx)
## DaMichel's Part Pack

 * Fuselage
 * Tanks
 * CargoBay: 2.5m
 * Radial RTG

For the lack of a better name. These parts are rectangular fuselage pieces meant to be radially attached. You get two center pieces, an air inlet, a terminal piece, an adapter to the standard 1.25 m parts and as extras a smallish tail boom and a slanted cone.

Notes

* This is a revision of the 2014 release. Now with better looking (i think) textures and mesh.

* ***RealFuels compatibiliy:*** configs are included.

* ***AJE compatiblity:*** The inlet has a configuration for AJE. I copied the config for the Sp+ rectangular inlet and made the inlet area larger. Not sure what i'm doing though.

* ***Swappable Tanks:*** If you have the Firespitter DLL and no RealFuels it will use it to give the parts swappable tanks. So you can chose between LF, LF+OX and MP variants.

* ***Usage of FerramAerospaceResearch*** is strongly recommended. The parts have some values for stock aerodynamic parameters but i have no idea if they are reasonable nor will i take the time to balance for stock. In contrast, FAR figures this stuff out automagically.

* ***ActiveTextureManager:*** I include a configuration which scaling in general and compression of the normal map. If you like a more aggressive configuration you should probably delete the cfg (damichel-fuselage-ATM.cfg).

* Relies on ***ModuleManager*** for the extra configurations, which is however not included. I haven't checked what happens if it is not already installed ...

Old Stuff Below

Edit: Update Mar, 06 2014. Current content:

* ***Spherical Tanks*** with 1.25 m base from 0.625 to 10 t.

* ***"Flat" Fuselage pieces*** including two tanks in two sizes, an intake, an end piece and a tail boom for radial attachment.

* ***Radial Aerodynamic RTG***, because i can. Has much lower drag in FAR than stock RTG due to not having attach nodes.

* ***New: Cargo Bay:*** 2.5 m diameter, relatively stock-like. Comes in heights of 1, 2 and 4 m for efficiency. Fits well to KWRocketry and B9 parts. The doors are designed to require less room for opening than a standard design made of a single door piece.

The CargoBay need the Firespitter DLL, which is not included at the moment. Get it from the Firespitter mod.

The Intake needs the KineTechAnimation DLL. It was included previously but since i don't want to keep track of it i removed it. Get it from the B9 mod or Taverio's Pizza and Aerospace.

The textures on the fuselage are deliberately a bit lowres. If you like it more highres, i can give you the original texture in twice the resolution next update.
